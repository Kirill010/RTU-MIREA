I would like to tell you about the search engines.
A search engine allows users to extract requested information on the Internet. 
Crawler-based search engines create lists using a special program to search for new content.
When the search robot finds a new website by a link, it scans and transmits it on for processing.
Indexing is performed by identifying words and expressions.
Ranking is the sorting of sites. 
Search engines compare the search string with indexed pages from the database to provide content.
Human-powered directories depend on human editors to compile their lists. 
A meta search system does not have its own database. 
It sends user requests and collects the best results into one common list.
