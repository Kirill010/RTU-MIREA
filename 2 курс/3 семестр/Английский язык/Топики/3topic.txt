I would like to tell you about computer hardware. The processor is the brain of the device that performs calculations and outputs results. 
The power is determined by the speed of processor.
The processor architecture is determined by the number of cores. Each processor core can perform different tasks.
To process the program and the data must be loaded into the main memory. RAM (random access memory) is volatile and stores data that is used by the computer. However, the ROM (read-only memory) is non-volatile. The BIOS (basic Input/Output system) uses ROM to control interaction with peripheral devices.
The main printed circuit board inside your system, called the motherboard, connects all computer components and is the "skeleton" of the computer.
