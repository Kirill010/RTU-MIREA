Fiber-optic Internet uses fiber-optic cables instead of copper wires. 
These cables transmit data to and from a computer using light energy and can transmit data over long distances.
Fiber-optic cables transfer data faster than copper wiring.

Wi-Fi is used for local area networks.
Satellite Internet allows the user to access the network through orbit.
It is a good solution for rural areas.
