I would like to tell you about the history of computers.
The earliest tools for counting were sticks and stones.
Abacus was invented in China.
Abacus can be used for arithmetic operations.
The first mechanical machine developed by
Blaise Pascal, could perform addition and subtraction in quicktime mode.
A major breakthrough in computing technology was made in the 1930s and 1950s.
Konrad Zuse designed the first electromechanical computer.
In 1946, the first digital computer using vacuum tubes was created.
An important event was the invention of ENIAC.
The ENIAC computer was large and weighed 27 tons.
During World War II, Alan Turing improved the machine could decipher the codes of the German Enigma machine.
The second generation computers were smaller and faster than the first generation computers.
And each time the computers got smaller and faster.
Currently, microprocessors are used in more electronic devices.
But now the feature of fifth-generation computers is the use of artificial intelligence. I like it, but I want the AI to make a better schedule
