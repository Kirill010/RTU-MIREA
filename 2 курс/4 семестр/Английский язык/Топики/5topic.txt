I would like to tell you about the malware and cybercrime.
Malware is program that damages your computer, for example viruses, worms, Trojans, and spyware. 
The virus can enter through a USB drive or over the Internet. 
A worm is a self-copying program; it sends copies to all users. 
The Trojan horse disguises itself as a useful program. 
Spyware collects information from your computer without your consent. 
There are many types of viruses. 
One of the dangerous types of viruses is a rewriting virus. 
This virus damages important information, sometimes disabling the computer. 
Another common virus is the resident virus. 
They remain inactive until they are activated by a certain event.
A DDoS attack is an attack in which hackers overload networks and servers with traffic.
