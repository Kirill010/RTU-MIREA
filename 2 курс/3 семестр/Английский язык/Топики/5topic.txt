I would like to tell you about the secondary storage.
The secondary storage are hard disk drives (HDD) and solid-state drives (SSD).
There are several types of media. For example: magnetic, optical, flash memory.
Magnetic devices store data by magnetizing particles on a disk or tape. 
The hard drive must be treated carefully.
Hard drives are sensitive to vibration during operation.
It consists of plates that are made up of a magnetic material.
However, a hard drive can store more data and retrieve information faster.
Optical storage is a type of storage in which data is read using a laser. 
Optical storage was used in variety of forms. For example: the CD, the DVD, The Blu-ray.
One of advantages is durability. 
Among disadvantages are speed and capacity. 
Nowadays, the Internet is used to transmit information.
