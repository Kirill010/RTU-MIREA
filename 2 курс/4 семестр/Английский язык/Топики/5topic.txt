I would like to tell you about the malware and cybercrime.
Malware is software designed to damage your computer, for example viruses, worms, Trojans, and spyware. 
The virus can enter through a USB drive or over the Internet. 
A worm is a self-copying program; it copies itself and sends copies to all users. 
The Trojan horse disguises itself as a useful program. 
Spyware collects information from your computer without your consent. 
Unlike viruses and Trojan horses, the worm does not need to connect to another program.
There are many specific types of viruses that you need to protect yourself from. 
One of the dangerous types of viruses is a rewriting virus. 
This virus damages important information, sometimes completely disabling the computer. 
Another common virus is the resident virus. 
They remain inactive until they are activated by a certain event.
A DDoS attack is an attack in which hackers overload networks and servers with traffic in such a way that computer systems are unable to meet legitimate needs.
