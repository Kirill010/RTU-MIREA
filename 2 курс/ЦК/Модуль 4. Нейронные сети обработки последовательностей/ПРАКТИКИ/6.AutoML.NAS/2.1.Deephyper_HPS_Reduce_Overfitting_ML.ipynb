We will consider [Random Forest (RF)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) classifier and [Gradient Boosting (GB)](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.html) classifier methods in [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) for the Airlines data set. Each of these methods have its own set of hyperparameters and some common parameters. We model them using ConfigSpace a python package to express conditional hyperparameters and more.\n","\n","Let us start by installing DeepHyper.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Для загрузки
