I would like to tell you about the software.
Software is a set of programs used to operate a computer system that performs specific tasks. 
There are system software and application software. 
System Software is general-purpose software, which is used to operate computer hardware. 
It acts as an interface between application programs and computer hardware. 
System software is designed to manage the system resources and provide a platform for application software to run. 
System software is usually written in low-level languages, like assembly languages.
Application software is designed to help the user perform a specific task.
Application software is usually written in high-level languages, like Java or C++. 
As a user interacts with an application program on the screen, the application program communicates with the operating system and the operating system communicates with the computer hardware.
The operating system is running in the background.
The most popular operating systems are Microsoft Windows and Mac OS.
