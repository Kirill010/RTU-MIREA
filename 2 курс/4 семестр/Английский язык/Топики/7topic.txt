I would like to tell you about the artificial neural networks.
Neural network can accomplish many tasks: from face recognition, to fraud detection. 
Neural networks are great tools for finding patterns.
Specific tasks include classification, clustering, and prediction, (for example, weather forecasting). 
Neural networks arenâ€™t programmed, they are trained. 
The network consists of layers of interconnected nodes, that process information and make decisions based on input data.
The connections are represented by a number called a weight. 
The higher the weight, the more influence one unit has on another.
