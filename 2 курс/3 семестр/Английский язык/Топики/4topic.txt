I would like to tell you about the primary storage.
Storage media are classified into primary and secondary. 
Primary storage can be volatile or non volatile. 
Examples are RAM and cache memory, which lose data, when the computer turns off.
The main function of RAM is to provide quick access to the CPU. 
The amount of RAM determines the speed and performance of the computer. 
If your computer system has too little RAM, it will slow down the work of the computer.
ROM can save data when the computer is turned off. 
There are several types of read only memory: 
1. MROM (Masked read-only memory);
2. PROM (Programmable read-only memory);
3. EPROM (Erasable programmable read-only memory);
4. EEPROM (Electrically erasable programmable read-only memory);
5. FLASH ROM.
Secondary storage devices are used to keep data by the long-term basis. 
Sometimes they are called auxiliary storage. 
They are non-volatile and do not have direct access to the CPU. 
They work much slower than the main storage, but have a much larger capacity.
Examples are hard disk drives and solid state drives.
