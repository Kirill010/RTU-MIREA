Use complex and unique passwords for each account and change them regularly.
Biometric authentication is a technology that uses fingerprints, or facial recognition, to verify a user's identity.
Utilizing antivirus software is essential for detecting and removing malware, such as viruses, worms, and trojans. 
Regular updating antivirus software and running system scans can help prevent cyber-attacks and data loss.
A firewall acts as a barrier between your computer and the internet, monitoring incoming and outgoing network traffic to block harmful data packets.
