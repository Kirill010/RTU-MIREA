I would like to tell you about the web design.
The main steps of creating a website include planning, designing, development, testing, and launching. 
The main benefits of website builders is that they create websites quickly and easily without the need for programming knowledge.
Interface development focuses on the visual aspects of a website. 
Three different tools are used to create these elements â€“ HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
Interface development includes behind-the-scenes website features such as databases, servers, and applications. 
The backend developer works with different databases (SQLite, MySQL, MongoDB), different servers (Nginx and Apache).
SEO is the search engine promotion of a website.
It helps to increase visibility on the Internet.
